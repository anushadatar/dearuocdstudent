    Obviously Google messed up. Obviously they accidentally included a picture of our professor in
    a list of images describing an assasinated engineer that goes by the same name. Obviously? I don't
    think so. Google, a multi-billion dollar business, messed up? There are too many similarities.
    Ben, Linder, an engineer, a mechanical engineer, with very similar looks. I think we need to explore more.
