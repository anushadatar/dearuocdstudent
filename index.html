    </h3>

    Obviously Google messed up. Obviously they accidentally included a picture of our professor in
    a list of images describing an assasinated enginner that goes by the same name. Obviously? I don't

    Ben, Linder, an engineer, with very similar looks. I think we need to explore more.
